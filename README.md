# Catalogue Microservice Repository

**Welcome to the "Catalogue Microservice" repository!** This repository is the home of a powerful microservice that plays a pivotal role in our project. With streamlined deployment using Helm, an automated CI/CD pipeline powered by Jenkins, and a well-structured directory layout, we've created a foundation for efficient development and deployment.

## Key Features

### Catalogue Microservice
Our "catalogue" microservice offers a comprehensive solution for managing product catalog information, enabling us to deliver a seamless and organized shopping experience to our users.

### Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
We've implemented a robust Jenkins CI/CD pipeline (Jenkinsfile) that automates the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensures that our "catalogue" microservice is continuously integrated, tested, and deployed with reliability and efficiency.

### Docker Containerization
The "catalogue" microservice is containerized using a carefully crafted Dockerfile. Containerization enhances scalability, portability, and deployment flexibility, making it suitable for various cloud or on-premises environments.

### Source Code
Our microservice's source code is meticulously organized and stored in the `src/` directory. Developers can easily access, modify, and extend its functionality, fostering collaborative and innovative development practices.

### Helm for Deployment
To ensure consistent and repeatable deployments, we utilize Helm charts. The Kubernetes Deployment YAML file (`manifest.yaml`) is securely stored within the `helm/` directory, providing a solid foundation for streamlined application management.

## Directory Structure

- `helm/`: This directory houses our Helm chart for deploying the "catalogue" microservice. It's the key to efficient and consistent Kubernetes deployments.
  - `manifest.yaml`: Kubernetes Deployment YAML file is at the core of our deployment strategy.
  
- `src/`: Our source code resides here. It's the heart of the "catalogue" microservice, where innovation and functionality come to life.

- `Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile is the bridge between development and deployment. It ensures that our microservice is packaged and ready to shine in the containerized world.

- `Jenkinsfile`: Our Jenkins pipeline configuration (`Jenkinsfile`) is the driving force behind our CI/CD process, automating everything from code changes to deployment.

## Getting Started

To embark on your journey with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment. This is your gateway to the powerful "catalogue" microservice.

2. Explore the `src/` directory to dive into the source code. Here, you have the freedom to shape, enhance, and innovate our microservice.

3. Use the Dockerfile to craft a container image for the "catalogue" microservice. This containerization allows you to scale and deploy with ease.

4. Leverage our Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile) for automated building, testing, and deployment. It's your trusty companion in delivering quality software efficiently.

5. When it's time to deploy in your Amazon EKS cluster, Helm and the provided Kubernetes Deployment YAML file (`manifest.yaml`) will be your partners in ensuring a smooth and consistent deployment process.

Welcome to a world of efficient development and deployment. Let's create something extraordinary!
